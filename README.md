# [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)
Become an expert in neural networks, and learn to implement them using the deep learning framework PyTorch. Build convolutional networks for image recognition, recurrent networks for sequence generation, generative adversarial networks for image generation, and learn how to deploy models accessible from a website.

## Introduction
Get your first taste of deep learning by applying style transfer to your own images, and gain experience using development tools such as Anaconda and Jupyter notebooks.

## [Secure and Private AI](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud185)
Learn how to extend PyTorch with the tools necessary to train AI models that preserve user privacy.

## [Neural Networks](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud188)
Learn neural networks basics, and build your first network with Python and NumPy. Use the modern deep learning framework PyTorch to build multi-layer neural networks, and analyze real data.

## [Introduction to TensorFlow Lite](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud190)
Learn how to deploy deep learning models on mobile and embedded devices with TensorFlow Lite.

## Recurrent Neural Networks
Build your own recurrent networks and long short-term memory networks with PyTorch; perform sentiment analysis and use recurrent networks to generate new text from TV scripts.

## Generative Adversarial Networks
Learn to understand and implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (generative adversarial network) to generate realistic images, with Ian Goodfellow, the inventor of GANs, and Jun-Yan Zhu, the creator of CycleGANs.

## Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model. Deployment gives you the ability to use a trained model to analyze new, user input. Build a model, deploy it, and create a gateway for accessing it from a website.
